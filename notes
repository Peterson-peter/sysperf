likely need to change to more of async 
add a hardware report
validate that each disk is connected at the right link speed.
Find the installed filesystem 
update bbc commands with the block size that is runing
install eBPF from source NOT from libbpf-tools
  missing output to json switch in the older libbpf-tools version 
Collect output from eBPF: 
  ./biolatpcts.py /dev/nvme0n1

  ./ext4slower -j 1
push the output off the box
roll this in to a custom boot image to run at pxe boot
